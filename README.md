# TV_Script_Generation
Here in this repository I have tried to create a Text Processing model that allows me to generate a TV Script after taking input from the 9 seasons of scripts of Seinfeld.  

I have taken a step by step process to create a notebook where we can go thorough the essentials of text processing using LSTM to formulate a new script of Sienfeld. Even thuogh the script created is not going to be exactly making perfect sense but the model would get the gist of how the script writing looks like and gets how to formulate a script. We need to use transfer learning with another model for our script to make sense of to story which is very tedious task but given the dataset the model learns exactly what is expected of it.
Not the best but still is a great repo.
